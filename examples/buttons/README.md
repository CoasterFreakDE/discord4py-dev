A simple calculator using Buttons
==================================

There are two versions of this calculator. [One](./calculator_ansi.py) that uses the [ansi syntax](https://gist.github.com/kkrypt0nn/a02506f3712ff2d1c8ca7c9e0aed7c06) to let the display looks better and [another](./calculator.py) that uses normal `py` highlight.

#### NOTE

```text
Currently (on 12.07.2022) the ansi syntax highlight is not available on all clients.
So if you're on PC it should work, but if you want that mobile users can use it too it's better to use the version without ansi.
```
### Usage examples

This video shows the [ansi version](./calculator_ansi.py)
